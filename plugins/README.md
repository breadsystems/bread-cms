# Bread CMS Plugins

Officially supported plugins that provide hooks wrapping popular Clojure libraries.

Support is planned for:

* Reitit
* Datomic (for optionally replacing Datahike with a more "enterprise" solution)
* Rum (for server-side rendering and eventually ClojureScript integration)
* Garden
