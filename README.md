Liberate your content.

## Basic Usage

```clojure
(ns my-project
    (:require [systems.bread.alpha.core :as bread]))

(defn hello [_]
    [:h1 "Hello, Breadsters!"])

(def handler
    (-> (bread/app)
        (bread/post-type :page
                         {:browse hello})
        (bread/app->handler)))

(handler {:uri "/"})
;; => [:h1 "Breadsters!"]
```

### A more detailed example

```clojure
;; namespace where your blog post type is defined
(ns my.project.blog
    (:require [systems.bread.alpha.finders :as finders]
              [my.project.helpers :as h])
    (:import [java.text SimpleDateFormat]))

(defn main-layout [{:keys [title headline content]}]

      [:main
       content]
      [:footer
       [:div "Main footer content"]]]])

;; Normal actions use main-layout. These are your standard
;; Read, Edit, Add, and Delete, AKA BREAD operations, minus the B for Browse.
(defn details [_] ...)
(defn edit [_] ...)
(defn add [_] ...)
(defn delete [_] ...)

### Resolvers

Resolvers in BreadCMS are conceptually similar to GraphQL/Pathom resolvers, but operate at a higher level of abstraction. They are responsible for taking a Ring request and resolving it to one or more Posts. As such, they can take arbitrary data on the request into account.

The standard, built-in resolvers use post slugs and parent/child post hierarchies as their criteria for resolving posts. For example, when handling a request for `/parent/child`, the standard post resolver queries for a post:

1. whose slug is `"child"`, and
2. whose parent is a post whose slug is `"parent"`

You can declare resolvers to trigger specifically for certain routes:

```clj
;; TODO what does this API actually look like?
(bread/route "/parent" {:route/key :parent
                        :route/resolver {:post/type :post.type/page
                                         :post/parent nil}})
```

In a custom routing scheme that declares a top-level `/parent/*` route (i.e. a wildcard route dispatched by slug underneath the umbrella `/parent` route),  Bread will recognize the fact that we are no longer looking for a parent page whose slug is `"parent"`, but are instead looking for posts of a certain type, or status, or whatever other criteria you want to define for your custom route.

Bread also has an API for defining your own resolvers that operate on arbitrary request data.
